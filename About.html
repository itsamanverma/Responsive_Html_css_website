                <p>I had completed my graduation Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.) program at Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering in 2017, Oriental College of Technology, Bhopal,
                                                                                     I had secured a CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) of 8.33(on a 10 point scale). My superlative performance in the field of academics has fetched me a number of awards at school, college, and national level.</p>
                <p class="dark">I have enhanced my technical skills, to upgrade my knowledge, and also to gain an industrial exposure, which would be beneficial. A strong desire to ingrain the fundamental principles of any subject of study has enabled me to adopt a rigorous and analytical approach to problem-solving. My fields of interest range over a wide spectrum of areas. But, my special interest lies in Programming Language like HTML, CSS, WordPress, C & C++, Still Working on JavaScript and Bootstrap.</p>
